Quickly search for menu items with support for multiple keyboard layouts.

== Description ==

A plugin for quick and easy search of menu items and sub-items, taking into account different keyboard layouts. This means that even if you enter text in English, but you have another keyboard layout active, the desired menu item will still be found!

The search field is added to the very top of the admin bar, ensuring that it is always accessible. And when I say permanent, I really mean **always**! I've added a hotkey for quick focus on this field - slash (/). And to quickly clear the input field if it's in focus, just press Esc and the field will clear, making all the menu items available again.
